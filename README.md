ANALYSIS OF SINGAPORE METRO STATIONS NETWORK

With the increasing population, traffic demand is coupled with an increasing number of vehicles on the road. As a result, we are facing many problems like traffic congestion, road accidents, and environmental pollution. This can be reduced only when the number of vehicles on the roads is decreased. We can achieve this by increasing public transportation. One of the most accepted methods to improve public transportation is the "Mass Rapid Transit " system. This has already been used in many of the developed countries and in developing countries including India. 
setting up metro stations involves the study of geographic and community factors in that particular surroundings. We have to understand the population around that particular metro rail station and then we have to construct the station. This will help 
the people to identify the station easily and use the station easily and hence they can 
effectively make use of the metro system.If a particular station is located in a populated community that station will be more important and if a station is more important then it may be considered as located in a populated community vice versa. Applications of social network analysis include
identifying the most influential person(s) in social networks, key infrastructure nodes in the internet or urban networks, rumor spreaders, and disease spreaders. In the same way, we could identify the important stations in the MRT network using centrality measures. In this paper, we used network analysis to find the most important stations in Singapore's metro networks. Here stations are considered as nodes. We 
used different centrality measures like degree centrality, betweenness centrality, 
Eigenvector centrality to achieve this. In graph theory and network analysis indicators of centrality identify the most important vertices in the graph. We generated the different graph attributes like degree centrality, Betweenness centrality, 
closeness centrality to identify the tightly interlinked groups within a network.
